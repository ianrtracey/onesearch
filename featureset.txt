New Integrations:

1. Slack
2. Quickbooks
3. Box
4. aribtrary file systems?


TODOS:

1. define what the v1 beta product looks like
2. define "nice to haves"


New ideas:

1. make docs files and sheet files have different logos
2. encrypt each instance to avoid data aggregation by host
3. index sources in db for fast lookups 
4. document searching and fulltext search
5. show content type
6. look into collecting links
7. 

Architecture:

* Thinking about using Passport and Node.js for server given its
request frequency and the ability to store a multitude of authentication
strategies

* The indexer will be written using Go's concurrency model

1. need to think about user account / company account models
2. how would encrpytion work per account
3. how does authentication with all of the integrations work?
4. Sidekiq or other task runner for background jobs to be handled
	* indexing changes in a Service
	* initial setup
	* email
5. React router or some routing system (done)

Indexer:
	- write it in go for optimum performance
 	- able to handle concurrent requests to api resources

Results
	- need to abstract away each result so that varying resource types
	displayed independent of other data sources
